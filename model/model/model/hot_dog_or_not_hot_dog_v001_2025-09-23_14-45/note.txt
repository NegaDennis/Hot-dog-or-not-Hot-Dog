since accuracy doesn't change that much, let's go back to Adam optimizer but with bigger batch size and stronger learning rate; last time we tried adam, those were too small and the model was not allow to be bolder.

RESULT: It is staggering. Val_accuracy reached ~0.8. Test_accuracy reached 0.7. I'd say it's a good enough accuracy for now. We will move on to building the app starting tomorrow.
